# IoT_Minor_PROJECT
This is created to have all my code and work here for my project for Internet of things 


The following code is to control the heat in the Revival Unit, to keep it under a certain heat as it is an enclosed box.

The temperature will be displayed to aware the farmer that the box is at the right temperature for the Lamb or if the temperature coudl be of higher. 
The temperature in the box is set below 30degrees for the first test, As I believe the second testing will be changed to below <26 degrees. Going by a home been heated and because it is a large area to heat. The incubation box is a small area 2x3foot and holds two lambs.
The Lambs temperature needs to get up to 39-40 degrees in order for the lamb to be healthy. 

Hyperthermia in Lambs can occur mild or severe 

mild 37-39 degrees 
severe (under 37degrees)
