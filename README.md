# IoT_Minor_PROJECT
This is created to have all my code and work here for my project for Internet of things 


The following code is to control the heat in the Revival Unit, to keep it under a certain heat as it is an enclosed box.

The temperature will be displayed to ensure the farmer that the box is at the right temperature for the Lamb. The Lambs temperature needs to get up to 39-40 degrees in order for the lamb to be healthy. 

Hyperthermia in Lambs can occur mild or severe 

mild 37-39 degrees 
severe (under 37degrees)
